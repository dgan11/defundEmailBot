My name is {fullname} and I live in Phoenix. I am writing to you as a constituent who is disturbed by the injustices and brutality carried out by police \
forces across the country, and particularly in the Phoenix PD. In February, the council approved a community review board and Office of Accountability and \
Transparency. They were given the power to:
-investigate and provide independent reports on police use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints
-make disciplinary recommendations for individual officers to the Police chief
-recommend policy changes based on research and community feedback
When the council approved the plan, it anticipated it would cost about $3 million, but in Wednesday’s 2020-21 budget decision it only received $400,000. \
In 2019, The Phoenix PD received $721 million from the City of Phoenix. The current City Manager recommendation is $741 million, a $20 million increase, \
yet they can’t provide $3 million to OAT. Ending police brutality should be a budget priority. Justice should be a budget priority. Without oversight, \
there will be no consequences. I demand that you, as a representative of the Phoenix constituents, fully fund the $3 million for the OAT, and redirect \
the additional $20 million for the Phoenix PD to social services and cultural programs, which are backbones of any healthy community. Thank you.

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Fremont. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopts a People’s Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing \

This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for a rapid and meaningful reconsideration of the role of policing in communities as well as an end \
to racism and anti-Blackness in America. The Bay Area has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for \
2021 is being decided as these protests continue.

Fremont PD has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the Fremont PD budget was $93,307,000, almost all of which comes from the Fremont general fund. This means \
Fremont PD cost us taxpayers almost 3 times as much as was spent on public street, facilities, and park maintenance, and human services combined. Fremont's projected \
2020-21 budget appears to be heading in an extraordinarily similar direction.

While we've been spending astonishing amounts of money on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. \
Instead, I see the wasteful and harmful actions of our police.

I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Fremont residents during \
this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. I call on you to slash the Fremont PD budget and instead meaningfully reallocate funds towards social \

Dear Mayor Michael Villalta and Council members,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Los Banos. I am emailing today to demand that you vote no on the Mayor's FY21 proposed budget. Furthermore, I urge you to pressure \
the office of the mayor towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the Los Banos expense budget, away from LBPD and towards social services and education programs, effective \
at the beginning of FY21.

I urge you and the rest of the city council to amend or deny the proposed budget for 2021. Redirect money away from LBPD and into social service programs that will benefit \
public health and our own communities, especially communities of color. The proposed budget for 2019-2020 suggests that the largest fraction of the city's budget should go to \
policing ($14,881,614), which is over 24% larger than even the second largest allocation of funds, fire ($5,268,311). If this is truly representative of the council's thoughts \
on how funds should be allocated, I am ashamed to call Los Banos my home and I am ashamed to call you my elected officials.

Crime is not random. Crime usually happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs through other means. So, to really "fight crime," we don't need more police \
officers - we need more jobs, more educational opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, as well as more of a say in how our own \
communities function. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating this funding!

We don't need a militarized police force. We need to create a space in which more mental health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor advocates, religious leaders, \
neighbors, and friends - all of the people who really make up our community - can look out for one another. Mayor Villalta, will you look out for me, and will you look out for us?

drastic overhaul in policing. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the budget for the MPD to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, \
public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved. I implore you to reconsider the upcoming budget. We are overdue for change.

Dear Orlando City Council Members,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of [district number]. This year, Mayor Dyer expressed that community safety was his top priority, yet only allocated 10,841,328 (0.8% of total budget) \
toward affordable housing and community development. Rather than prioritize quality of life for all of Orlando with a proportional housing and development budget, Mayor Dyer chose to prioritize \

of the budget away from OPD and towards safe housing, social services, and education programs, effective at the beginning of FY 2020-2021. Mayor Dyer has become complicit in his tenure as mayor \

To the commissioners that represent statistically wealthy, white neighborhoods, do not forget our poor communities and BIPOC communities who are disproportionate targets of police violence. \
Justice will only be served when OPD is reformed, and this will not be possible until we defund them.

I am therefore writing to demand that the City Council vote to reapportion funds allocated to the CPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police presence, \
promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is morally reprehensible to dedicate 40% of the City’s operating budget (approximately $4 million per day) towards policing while thousands \
of citizens are homeless and many more lack access to essential services, including clean running water and necessary mental health resources.

I also urge the City Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity. As set forth by Black Lives \
Matter of Chicago, I ask that Homan Square be immediately closed (a site where extrajudicial police interrogations are known to occur), that an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council be \
established with real reform powers, and that abusive cops be fired and criminally charged. Ending the unfair and secretive internal CPD grievance review process would be a good first step in achieving this goal.

To whom it may concern,

My name is {fullname} and I am a Baltimore resident. I am one of many Baltimore City residents urging our City Council members and Mayor Jack Young to ethically reallocate the Baltimore City Expense Budget. We are asking our elected officials to divest interest in the BPD, and invest in social services and education programs, \
effective at the beginning of FY 2021. We have seen clearly from experience, and from all current research, that armed police do not reduce crime and poverty, and in many instances increase crime and violence by perpetuating cycles and perpetrating violence themselves. Several City Council members have already made it clear that \
they stand with the residents of Baltimore City on this and plan to vote in favor of these types of changes in next week’s budget hearings. They have also made us aware of the fact that the Baltimore Police Department is not locally controlled by the City Council as it is a State Agency. Because of this, Baltimore City Government \
only has so much ability to implement change.

So I am reaching out to you today to urge you to support the residents of Baltimore City in our efforts. We have had enough of the violent approach to “controlling” poverty and crime and are ready to completely re-imagine what community safety looks like. Investment in programs such as the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, Baltimore \
Children and Youth Fund, Safe Streets Baltimore, the Office of Employment and Development, or the Department of Health, shows our commitment to communities and the vision that all Baltimore residents deserve to thrive. It’s time to defund the BPD’s harmful expansion into homeless services, schools, youth services, mental health, \
and other social services where police don’t belong. It’s time to increase investments in human services, the social safety net, and racial and economic justice.

We ask that you support us in our effort towards finding sustainable, long term change by giving control of BPD to Baltimore’s local government and in any other ways you can. It is time for change and we know we can build a better future based on restorative justice and healing.

Thank you,

To do this, we must redirect funds, disproportionately given to the police, to more effective services for public safety such as educational, mental health, housing, and employment programs. I trust you to ensure that a gradual and equitable defunding transition will occur so that members negatively impacted will have the resources to secure financial stability.

As Dallas police chief David Brown eloquently states, “We’re asking cops to do too much in this country. We are. Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, let the cops handle it… Here in Dallas, we got a loose dog problems; let’s have the cops chase loose dogs. Schools fail, let’s give it to the cops… That’s too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all of those problems.”

I hope you keep this in mind and do everything that you can to ensure justice and safety for our community.

Dear Montgomery County Officials,

My name is {fullname}  and I am a resident of Montgomery County, MD. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-blackness, and immediate reform in how black people are treated in America. Our county has been at the forefront of much of this action.

The brutal, senseless, and violent murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers derelict in their duties to protect and serve is deeply disturbing. We, as a nation, are in need of a drastic overhaul in policing. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the budget for the MPD to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved.

Montgomery County's Police is not exempt from racial issues. There is story after story of black people being harassed, searched and arrested for simple being black.

How many of you have been arrested for helping a drunk neighbor home?
What about standing outside of a McDonalds?
What about walking down the street?
Will Jawando himself was stopped for driving while black. If even elected officials are not safe from this treatment, how can the average person have any sense of safety and trust in the police?

This is not acceptable behavior for people expected to uphold the law and keep all members of the community safe. There are consequences to actions. Even if you wear a badge.

Civil Servants,

My name is {fullname}, and I am a citizen of Portland, Maine. I am a taxpayer and a voter.

I am writing to ask that you provide no new funding for the Maine Association of Police (MAP). I am also asking that you halt all funding that has already been approved.

According to documents on the city website, MAP received an overall increase of 5.3% in the budget plan for 2020. I ask you to refuse to increase the budget for MAP in the year 2021 and defuse all unspent funds into organizations throughout the state that are for essential human services, which MAP has proven not to be.

With the economic impact that COVID-19 has had on Maine’s economy, difficult and thoughtful decisions will be required when it comes to the budget for Maine in 2021. Mainers are experiencing homelessness, illness, unemployment, loss of income, and police brutality in record numbers. The people that have burdened the brunt of this are People of Color, Indigenous peoples, the poor, and the working class.

Data shows that Black people are three times more likely to be arrested than whites in Portland. In addition to that Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color in Maine are disproportionately subject to policing, arrests, and incarcerations. This proves that SYSTEMATIC RACISM IS PRESENT HERE IN MAINE AND IS PERPETUATED BY THE MAINE ASSOCIATION OF POLICE. Defunding the police will be the first step towards improving the quality of living for People of Color that are Mainers. It will divert funds from going to an institutionally racist association and allow those funds to be diverted to human services that need them badly.

Please do the right thing. Prioritize the health and safety of Maine residents.

REFUSE TO FUND THE MAINE ASSOCIATION OF POLICE.

Hi, my name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Kalamazoo. I'm writing to let you know that I think that Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety's use of chemical agents on peaceful protesters in late May and early June, including youth, constituted excessive force. I also think that the curfew and the presence of the National Guard in our city on June 2 did more to harm and scare us than it did to keep us safe.

This kind of behavior is a long standing pattern with KDPS, a police force with multiple questionable in custody deaths, excessive force accusations, a documented habit of pulling over predominantly black drivers, and enough unnecessary lethal equipment to outfit a small army. The time for hiding behind canned apologies, promises of diversity training and "community policing" is over. It's time to reduce police spending and reallocate those funds to programs that have real tangible benefits, especially to communities harmed by decades of over-policing and discrimination.

Kalamazoo Public Safety takes up 48% of the entire general fund budget for 2020. Other public services account for a paltry 8% and parks and recreation a depressing 4% of budget. That is outrageous and needs to change. Kalamazoo needs dollars for services that actually improve and lift up our community. Dollars for education, for food assistance, for housing, for people. Not policing.

Additionally, I want to see the following actions taken by KDPS and the City Commission to hold them accountable for their violence toward our community:
IMMEDIATELY:
KDPS will cease the use of tear gas or other chemical weapons
KDPS will cease the use of riot gear or other provocative dress when interacting with the public
KDPS will wear body cams at all times, always on and unobstructed
The Kalamazoo City Commission will order an independent investigation into KDPS response to public protests beginning May 30
KDPS will provide a weekly public briefing on the progress of their own investigations into police conduct related to public protests beginning May 30
WITHIN 2 WEEKS:
KDPS will develop and ongoing plan for quarterly reporting, to the public, of all complaints against the department or its officers, and the resolution of each
WITHIN 3 MONTHS:
ALL KDPS officers who interact with the public will have participated in racial healing circle with members of the community, led by trained facilitators
KDPS will adopt a policy requiring its officers live within the boundaries of the area the department serves

Please keep my interests in mind as you continue to discuss these matters and work toward justice in our community.

More broadly, we call for an end to police terror and anti-Blackness.

I recognize the importance of education. It is imperative that Black students are free from police violence and terror in their schools. That is not possible if the district continues its relationship with local police departments and private security companies. I urge Saint Paul Public Schools to follow the lead of Minneapolis Public Schools, and take action to divest from policing in the district.

To that end, I demand that SPPS immediately terminate all of their relations with police departments and private security companies. These policing institutions enact the same violence in our own communities as we have seen this week in Minneapolis, and through these relations our public schools support this violence and continue to uphold the white supremacy that is foundational to this country.

I join students, teachers, parents and alumni around the country in our demand that schools remove police and security officers from SPPS. I call on SPPS to take the following actions –
1. Break ties immediately with the police departments and private security companies in that contract with SPPS. Police, and their proxies, private security companies, have no place on elementary, middle and high school campuses.
2. Redirect funds divested from policing to provide educational opportunities for communities impacted by police violence.
3. Commit resources to support community-led alternatives to policing.
4. Propose plans for ensuring the safety of Black and other marginalized students on campus from racial profiling by police and other security forces with input from members of the Black, indigenous and other communities of color themselves.
5. Issue statements condemning these recent murders.

Although the murder of George Floyd was the catalyst for these recent protests, it was not the sole cause. Black people have been subjected to centuries of state terror, and economic and social exclusion. The current protests reflect concerned members of society taking direct, collective action to demand an end to the abuse and violence directed against Black people.

Dear Mayor Pam and Chapel Hill Town Council,

I am asking you all to actively defund the police, to clarify how much Town Council plans to defund the police in advance of the Public Hearing on June 10, and provide evidence of how the initiatives discussed by Mayor Pam "yielded positive results," with statistical or testimonial breakdowns by race or ethnicity.

As a resident of Chapel Hill, I am calling you to actively defund the police and limit its reach into our communities, especially those of Black and ethnic minorities. The "slight" cuts mentioned by Mayor Pam, which were already anticipated due to Covid-19, undermines global outcries to actively and intentionally limit the funding of programs that inadvertently promote police brutality, violence, and discrimination. Many of the policies Mayor Pam listed actually work to extend the reach of police violence and discrimination under the guise of progress. I am worried about these initiatives given what I am seeing every day. Who exactly is benefiting and who is being harmed? For example, the Good Neighbor Initiative in Northside, a historically Black community, deserves close scrutiny since it can enable the internal bias and target Black residents when a noise complaint can lead to a court fee, criminal charge, arrest, or murder.

Council must act and be proactive to redistribute funds away from the police. Although cities and towns across the country have implemented many of the 8cantwait policies mentioned by Mayor Pam, these same cities and towns regularly see the murder and discrimination of Black and minority ethnicities. The 8cantwait policies are not what I am calling for. Rather, the most direct way to avoid police brutality and discrimination is to significantly shift the budget away from the Chapel Hill Police Department.

I call on Chapel Hill Town Council to take the following actions:

  1. Redirect funds divested from policing to provide educational opportunities, youth programs, environmental justice initiatives, mental health resources, agricultural and food-based inequality programs, sexual assault services, and social work services to our communities.

  2. Ensure that Covid-19 budget cuts do not affect important community programs but the budget rather be drawn from the Chapel Hill Police Department

  3. Commit resources to support community-led alternatives to policing, such as social work programs.

  4. Propose plans for ensuring the safety of Black and other marginalized people in our community from racial profiling by police and other security forces with input from members of the marginalized communities themselves.

If Council members in larger cities, such as Minneapolis, Saint Paul, New York, and Los Angeles, are actively working to limit community ties with the police and implement defunding strategies, I am optimistic that the town of Chapel Hill can do the same. I am urging you, Chapel Hill Town Council, to adopt a budget that defunds the police and funds non-violent, community-led, health, and safety strategies. This is a time that will be stamped in public memory, where residents can say whether our Town Council members did or did not actively engage to significantly defund the police.

I write to express my concern that status quo funding of the CMPD is wholly inappropriate at a time when Charlotte residents ravaged by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are in urgent need—not of further policing and criminalization, but of meaningful reprioritization towards their social wellbeing.

Specifically, Black Charlotteans have not only experienced disproportionate deaths from COVID-19, but have long been policed and incarcerated at rates far above their share of the population. The CMPD uses lethal force against Black residents over 3 times as often as white residents. Longstanding police tactics, as exemplified most recently by the violent repression of peaceful protests uptown, have been wrought against the interests of our city’s wellbeing. As such, a CMPD that siphons over 40% of the city’s general fund is unacceptable.

Decades of scholarship show that education and social programs are much more effective at promoting safer communities than policing, and yet the city’s answer to every perceived problem has the continued expansion of the CMPD.

I implore you to advocate for the revision of the 2021 budget, for a meaningful reduction in the proposed $290,200,000 allocated for policing from the general fund, and a reallocation of these funds towards housing, education, and targeted support for marginalized communities.

Dear Mayor Schewel & City Council Members:

My name is {fullname}  I am a resident of Durham. I am writing to object to the allocation of over $70M to the Durham Police Department in the 2020-2021 city budget. It is indefensible to increase the police budget when city workers are experiencing layoffs and denial of wage increases, and thousands of our community members face unemployment and housing/food insecurity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The police cannot protect us from these challenges. In fact, more often than not, when police are dispensed, rather than more qualified medical, psychiatric, and social work professionals, the effect is to bring violence where none previously existed. Moreover, to paraphrase an existing council member, it is not cities with the most police, but the most resources, that are the safest.  To that end, I make a two-fold request to the council:

Reallocate all proposed increases in police budget to Durham Public Schools, affordable housing and rent subsidies, eviction diversions, food resources, and medical supplies, which have both immediate and longstanding consequences that will more positively affect our current residents.
Implement a plan to reallocate existing police resources to institutions and experts better equipped to deal with many of the issues DPD have been conscripted, without adequate training, to do. Resources should be allocated to EMTs, social workers, and other social service providers to respond to the majority of current police business, including health and wellness checks, domestic/sexual violence situations, and basic bureaucratic documentation around break-ins, vandalism, wrecks, etc. Additional money should go to community education around de-escalation and community support for drug, SV/DV, and property-related incidents. There is no reason to have armed officers responding to the majority of emergency needs in Durham.

Finally, I request that you divest from offensive weapons. Offensive weapons are known to escalate violence, especially when deployed in situations where none existed before. Almost all the current litany of Black men and women dead from police violence were non-violent, unarmed people, for whom armed police became the site of death and brutality.

Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?

Thank you,

Dear Mayor Baldwin,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Raleigh. I urge you and the rest of the city council to amend or deny the proposed budget for 2021. I would like to redirect money away from RPD and into social service programs that will benefit public health and our own communities, especially communities of color. The proposed budget for 2021 suggests that the largest fraction of the city’s budget should go to policing ($110,650,573), which is over 60% larger than even the second largest allocation of funds, fire ($67,687,901). If this is truly representative of the council’s thoughts on how funds should be allocated in a city in which over 6,000 of my neighbors (Raleigh + Wake County) are currently experiencing homelessness and in which nearly 100,000 of my neighbors (Raleigh + Wake County) are impoverished and at risk of becoming homeless (www.raleighrescue.org), I am ashamed to call Raleigh my home and I am ashamed to call you my elected officials.

Crime is not random. Crime usually happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs through other means. So, to really "fight crime," we don't need more police officers - we need more jobs, more educational opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, as well as more of a say in how our own communities function. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating this funding!

We don't need a militarized police force. We need to create a space in which more mental health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor advocates, religious leaders, neighbors, and friends - all of the people who really make up our community - can look out for one another. Mayor Baldwin, will you look out for me, and will you look out for us?

Hello,

I am a resident of Manchester. I am writing to demand that the Manchester Board of Mayor and Alderman adopt a People’s Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.

Our country, state, and city are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

We are in the midst of a pandemic with severe economic consequences. As of April 2020, the unemployment rate in Hillsborough county has skyrocketed, and we can expect 42% lasting unemployment. Over 50% of Manchester residents are renters. When people are unemployed, they cannot pay rent; economic insecurity and housing uncertainty are sure to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supporting communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. Yet the FY 2021 Budget would support the hiring of additional officers to the Manchester Police Department. Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons (Source: Popular Democracy). As such, I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas, particularly in response to the economic impact of COVID-19.

Do not forget our poor communities and communities of color who are disproportionate targets of police violence and disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Justice will only be served when the police are reformed, and our communities receive more support. This will not be possible until we defund them and commit to empowering our community.

# DefundThePolice. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Manchester residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.
We demand that the Board of Mayer and Alderman defund the Manchester Police Department. We join the calls of those across the country to

It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the proposed budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund

Hello,

My name is {fullname}. I am a resident of Albuquerque, and I am emailing today to demand an overhaul to our Albuquerque Police Department budget in light of the Black Lives Matter protests being demonstrated across the US, but specifically our city.

WE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL:

1. Vote no on all increases to police budgets
2. Vote yes to decrease police spending and budgets
3. Vote yes to increase spending on healthcare, education, housing, and community programs that keep us safe.

The militarized tactics that police departments are using against citizens is unacceptable and unwarranted. We have seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions that put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the approved 2020 FY budget allocated 64% of our Public Safety fund to the Albuquerque Police Department. To ensure your dedication to our city and citizens, I demand that you defund the Albuquerque Police Department and start providing more support and funding towards our community efforts and organizations that serve our predominantly Latinx and Black communities, as these are the communities that are being targeted the most. By doing so, I believe this will prevent further police brutality and violence in the future.

The Albuquerque Police Department states on the cabq.gov website that “(they) help provide a safe and secure community where the rights, history, and culture of all are respected!” If this true, we demand you listen to our concerns and implement change.

Black and Latinx communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent $60 billion on police and corrections. In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 percent increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of Black communities, local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, which leaves Black and Latinx people vulnerable and our communities no safer.

Where could that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of our elders and children, to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare, to support a vibrant Black and Latinx future. The possibilities are endless.

We join in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the United States. And we call for the end to police  terror.

To the Buffalo Common Council and Office of Mayor Byron Brown,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Buffalo. I am imploring you to meaningfully restrict the Buffalo Police Department's $121.9 million dollar budget immediately. On June 5, Buffalo Police officers pushed a non-violent 75 year old man to the ground while he was exercising his first amendment rights. In case you have not seen the footage, it is linked below.

I am calling for these officers to be charged and removed from service, effective immediately. I am calling for Mayor Brown and the Buffalo Common Council to have an emergency meeting regarding this matter. I am asking that an action plan for sustainable, long-term change is created and upheld.

Recreational programming for the elderly is budgeted at $1M, while the net budget for youth programs is $401K. Buffalo has the nation's fourth worst poverty rate for children, with almost one half of children in Buffalo living in poverty. The police were allocated 30,000% more funding than our city’s youth in the 2019-20 city budget.

In one of this country’s poorest cities, the majority of taxpayer dollars are funding a police department that has had 15 cases of alleged police brutality or excessive force since 2006. Of those 15 victims, 13 of them, or 86%, were people of color. An outline of these cases are included as a post-script to this email, alongside my sources.

This is unacceptable, and I am calling on the Buffalo Common Council, Buffalo Police Commissioner, and Mayor Byron Brown to reduce the Buffalo Police department's budget, and re-allocate police funding to invest in our community--as a start. Improving our educational system, local opportunities for economic growth, and programs that fight hunger and housing are proven to be more effective than police presence in improving community safety and wellness.

How will you show up for a city in desperate need of help? Spending $121.9 million dollars on the Buffalo Police is not the solution.

Hello, my name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Cleveland.

The City of Cleveland needs to address the lack of investment in predominantly Black communities and the over-investment in their criminalization. Although the 2020 city budget was already approved in March, the City of Cleveland must reduce its Division of Police budget.

$217,908,375 of the $1.8 billion budget is allocated to the Division of Police, an increase of $10 million from 2019. That increase is greater than the entire 2020 Department of Housing budget.

After a two year investigation ending in 2014, the Justice Department cited CPD for abuse due to a pattern and practice of excessive force. Ohioans understand this resulted in a consent decree that mandates certain budget allocations. Ohioans also expect and deserve compliance and progress with the consent decree. In April 2020, Desmond Franklin was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. In December 2019, 13-year-old Tamia Chappman was killed in a high-speed police chase while walking to the library. We cannot rely on the Division of Police to “self-evaluate in order to improve in areas of training, efficient and effective delivery of services, officer safety, and community engagement” in the best interest of the public, like the staffing report claims.

Mayor Frank Jackson is complicit in the crisis of police brutality. Tragic killings of Black Cleveland citizens by police violence — including Timothy Russell, Malissa Williams, and Tamir Rice — happened under Mayor Jackson’s tenure.

In an interview with The Appeal on June 3 2020, Mayor Jackson said:
a) he would not revisit reallocating police budget now
b) Cleveland cannot rely on the government to help end structural racism and police violence and we should instead look to philanthropy and the private sector.
…If not now, when? If government can’t help fix itself, who can? The burden does not lie on citizens. I demand you reconsider these stances to help end, not mitigate, police brutality.

Cleveland City Council cares about these issues. The recent unanimous vote to declare racism a public health crisis proves that. I ask that you continue to find sustainable, long-term change for the entire community.

Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons. Redirect money from the Division of Police and instead invest in social services. The policing budget can be better spent on quality of life for all, particularly in predominantly Black and brown communities. Programs like education, housing, healthcare, cooperative businesses, and community centers deserve that funding.

Thank you.

Hello, my name is {fullname} and I live in Columbus.

WE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL:

1. Vote no on all increases to police budgets
2. Vote yes to decrease police spending and budgets
3. Vote yes to increase spending on Health care, education and community programs that keep us safe.

Black communities across the nation are mourning the deaths of George Floyd, tortured to death by Minneapolis police, Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was killed while running in a residential neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, Breonna Taylor an EMT killed while asleep in her bed in Louisville,KY, Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis and Tony McDade in Tallahassee. Their names are added to a devastatingly long list of Black people who have been killed at the hands of vigilantes or law enforcement. Not to mention the others whose names we don’t yet know, and may never know since they were killed without a camera recording it.

At the same time, the United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases. So far, more than 100,000 people — enough to fill a football stadium– have perished from the virus,with over one million cases confirmed, and those numbers don’t reflect all the people dying from virus-related illnesses. Black people are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19, four times more likely to die than their white neighbors.

It is important to state this within the context of the scourge of anti-Black police terror and the resulting uprisings taking place across the U.S.

The COVID-19 deaths and the deaths caused by police terror are connected and consequential to each other. The United States does not have a national healthcare system. Instead, we have the largest military budget in the world, and some of the most well-funded and militarized police departments in the world, too. Policing and militarization overwhelmingly dominate the bulk of national and local budgets. In fact, police and military funding has increased every single year since 1973, and  at the same time, funding for public health decreased every year, crystallized  most recently when the Trump administration eliminated the US Pandemic Response Team in 2018, citing “costs”.

Black communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent $60 billion on police and corrections . In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 percent increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of Black communities, local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, which leaves Black people vulnerable and our communities no safer.

Where could that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of our elders and children,to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare, to support a vibrant Black future. The possibilities are endless.

We join in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the United States. And we call for the end to police terror.

The People of Columbus, OH

Dear Oklahoma City Mayor, City Council, and Manager,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of OKC. The City of Oklahoma City must do better by its residents. I am urging you to divest from the criminalization of our communities and reduce police spending in the budget for the 2021 fiscal year. In May, City Manager Freeman formally proposed deep spending cuts due to the pandemic. I am asking that you make a more overt and visible commitment to racial justice by delaying the budget approval so that the City Council may find ways to divest from OKCPD.

I urge you to pressure the City Manager’s Office towards an ethical reallocation of the city’s expenditures towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality. This includes, but is not limited to improving access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing, which have proven far more successful at promoting community safety and social equity than policing. As such, I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas.

In the FY2021 budget proposal, police receive $226,051,993 out of a total $1,658,405,738. The police budget is an 11% increase year over FY2020, despite having fewer positions. I know many of you feel strongly about racial justice and equity. On May 30th, Mayor Holt said the City must “continue to seek equity in all things, including opportunities for engagement, leadership and investment.” It is time to take action.
Individual solutions will not fix systemic problems. It is time for OKC, its leaders, and residents to create a more equitable city for all of us. Have the moral clarity to create a budget focused on communities instead of investing in a racist and destructive institution. Defund the Oklahoma City Police Department.

I am a resident of Portland.

In early May, Mayor Ted Wheeler released his proposed budget for the City of Portland. This included a policing budget of $236,991,195, which is over $10 million more than last year! The Portland Police Bureau (PPB), with Wheeler at its helm as Commissioner, has been mired in controversy over the last year with collusion with prominent white nationalist groups, shootings of Black people and people perceived to be in mental health crisis, data uncovered on their racist gang enforcement traffic stops, and the fact that a shameful 52% of people arrested are houseless.

Additionally and critically, Wheeler's budget ELIMINATES $1.8 million to fund the police body camera program. More money for policing but less money for police accountability is completely unacceptable.

I oppose any increases to the PPB budget. Over the course of last year, PPB increased their budget from the approved $227 million to $233 million - an increase that is easier for policing to achieve than most other departments. We anticipate that PPB will attempt a similar increase this year, pushing their budget even higher than the proposed $237 million, thus we stand even more firmly against this increase. We also continue to oppose the proposed funding in this year's budget for body cameras which are not shown to reduce the occurrence of police violence but rather are used to surveil and criminalize community members.

Wheeler's proposed budget does have a few positive aspects, including a proposed reduction of $2 million in the budget due to vacancy of 75 police officer positions. However, at a minimum salary of $61,000 per entry level officer, this amount should total at least $4,575,000, not including costs of benefits and taxes for these 75 vacant positions. Portland should continue to reduce the budget based on officer vacancy so that we move towards permanently reducing the number of police officers and reducing the budget. Care Not Cops supports the review and analysis of PPB directives and traffic stop data, however we demand this funding and all associated assessment be separated from the policing department.

The police budget increases regularly while other services are cut. I can see the ways in which policing continues to perpetuate violence against Black, brown, houseless people, and against people in mental health crisis. While Wheeler's proposal represents a slight decrease from the PPB proposal, the PPB is a department whose reach into Portland communities needs to be curtailed through reducing the budget, not by increasing it.

More money for policing but less money for police accountability is completely unacceptable at this moment in history. The city, the state, and country are all watching. And so am I. I call on the Mayor, the Commissioners, and all other City Council Members to use their powers to continue to reduce the budget and pledge to increase Police accountability and transparency. I promise that you will lose my support and my vote if you aren't willing to make a public and vocal stand to help defund the PPB and increase their accountability and transparency.

Hello,

I am a Portland resident. I have been following the recent protests against police brutality, and I am increasingly disturbed by the use of force by police in this city. There are plenty of videos showing police attacking citizens over the past few days, usually unprovoked and without discretion. Tonight, there was no curfew in place and yet still police used violent force in the name of "dispersing crowds". The constitution is very clear about the peoples' First Amendment rights to peacefully assemble.

I've linked to a few videos of PPB using terror tactics on citizens tonight:
https://twitter.com/matcha_chai/status/1268043556913987584
https://twitter.com/CAIROregon/status/1268039476938305536
https://twitter.com/alex_zee/status/1268047762848800768
Here's the PPB's reasoning for using chemical weapons on citizens: https://twitter.com/PortlandPolice/status/1268042456148271104

If I'm to understand -- the issue is that they were too close to a fence? So the police were authorized to use chemical weapons and 40mm bullets on citizens? It is increasingly clear that the most violent actors in our city are the police. If their terror tactics are the result of orders from the Chief and the Police Commissioner, then you both must step down immediately. If they are NOT acting under the direct orders of the Chief and the Commissioner, then you must investigate the actions of these officers.

The PPB's behaviors this weekend are offensive to me. Tonight is absolute proof that the police MUST be defunded and have their military-grade weapons taken away -- it is a danger to the citizens of Portland to allow police to continue using violent force and chemical weapons on the citizens of our city who are protesting that very same force. It is clear to me that the brutality the protesters are fighting against is alive and well in our city.

Police reform is not enough, and has proven time and time again to be ineffective at reducing police killings and brutality
[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why].
Body cams do not equal accountability and bias training does not reduce the number of Black people, Indigenous people, Latinx people and others disproportionately targeted by "law enforcement".

If you want to "tackle crime", dedicate yourselves fully to ending poverty-- don't give the police force another 246.2 million to spend on riot gear, grenades, and chemical weapons to use against your city.

Now is a chance for Portland to lead the country and show how demilitarization and defunding the police can create a safer city for all of us.

Hello Multnomah County commissioners,

My name is {fullname} and I live in Portland OR. I am writing to urge that the county divest from the systems of incarceration and policing, and instead invest in life affirming, sustainable, and self-determined community resources.

Many community members in Multnomah County were in crisis prior to COVID-19, and while we do not yet know the full impact of this pandemic, we know that those who will be most affected by it are communities who are already socially and economically marginalized.

Now, when the need for supportive services is even greater, the county has instead proposed increases towards programs like gang enforcement teams, electronic monitoring, body cameras, and increased jail funding.

County officials have a responsibility to respond to this crisis by distributing resources that allow communities to survive and thrive - solutions can not revolve around criminalization, jail time, houseless encampment sweeps, or the surveillance and harassment of Black neighborhoods and immigrant communities through anti-gang policing.

Funding toward life-affirming resources such as those related to housing, access to health care, and food security, must be prioritized, especially in the midst of a major budget shortfall. Difficult decisions made now will have reverberating impacts well into our future. We can make the choice to fund people, not policing & incarceration.

Our demands are:

Reject the $6.4 million increase to the Sheriff's Department

Divest from Homeless Outreach and Programs Engagement (HOPE) and instead direct resources towards dignified temporary and permanent housing and rent relief; halt sweeps of houseless encampments and other villages.

Reject increased funding and divest from Adult Electronic Monitoring, Adult Field Supervision.

Reject increased funding and divest from Body Worn Camera programs.

Deny the Sheriff Department's proposition to use $1.08 million from the general fund to keep Dorm 15 at Inverness Jail from closing.

Divest from the Juvenile East Multnomah Gang Enforcement Team & the Gang Enforcement Deputy.

Invest in life affirming solutions to Multnomah County's needs by building up community-based and peer-led services and resources. No reductions in the Housing Stabilization for Vulnerable Populations, an d the Aging, Disability, and Veterans Services Division (ADVSD) Safety Net Program.

A 2% cut across all programs fails to address that some programs sustain networks for survival, while others do not. The economic impact of COVID-19 instead requires a complete reimagining of how we allocate county resources, and makes clear the necessity for prioritizing investments in communities' health and well-being. The county can address its $58 million (and growing) deficit in the $1.98 billion budget by divesting from the violence of policing and incarceration. The systems of policing and incarceration have no role in public health or safety; prisons and jails are vectors for the spread of COVID-19 and have always been antithetical to public health.
Existing racial and economic disparities will only worsen in the wake of this ongoing crisis. We know that this virus is disproportionately affecting Black and brown communities & that this disparity is caused by racist systems that affect how and when people receive care.

Action now to invest in long-term, and life sustaining resources will serve to insulate our communities from the effects of this pandemic in the future. We know that meeting the basic needs of our communities is the only way to ensure their health and safety.

Thank you,

Hello,

I am writing to demand the city stops increasing the Pittsburgh Police Budget and redirects funding into supporting community operations.

The Pittsburgh Operating Budget's total designated expenditures allocate 40.0% to Public Safety and only 10.5% to Public Works. This is unacceptable.

The 2020 budget for the Bureau of Police is $114,787,000. This is ~18.9% - nearly one fifth - of the overall City Operations Budget.

There is only $1,758,022 allocated to the Office of Equity. The Ethics Hearing Board budget went down by $6,974 from 2019-2020 while the Police Bureau budget increased by $10,241,674. What is the need for this increase?

The first 2020 goal listed in the Bureau overview is “Continue to increase the ‘boots on the ground’ officers in the field”. Is this what the increase will go toward? What is the reasoning for needing more police on the ground? Due to the overwhelming evidence that the police are targeting Black people in this city (and across the world), it is the correct move to divest from funding boots on the ground operations and invest in upholding policies that support the people.

The Neighborhood and Community Development fund was only allocated $7,502,080 for 2020. That is ~6.8% of the 2020 Capital Budget. This is not enough. I demand you take action to re-allocate money away from the Pittsburgh Police and back into community development that includes affordable housing and reparations for Black citizens. Both the state and the Pittsburgh Police owe the Black community a great debt.

It is clear that Pittsburgh Police funds are not being appropriately used to maintain safety and freedom on the streets of Pittsburgh. This is not only obvious by the City Budget, it is obvious by how Pittsburghers are treated by the police. Black Pittsburghers are disproportionately subject to this violence. Antwon Rose was shot dead in our city by a police officer and we will always remember. Elijah Brewer was shot dead in our city by a police officer and we will always remember.

Dear Mayor Peduto,

My name is {fullname} and I am a resident of Pittsburgh.

From reports of protesters being attacked around the city to the killing of Antwon Rose in East Pittsburgh - the police have shown that they are not doing their jobs to serve and protect all citizens of this city.

In 2020 the Bureau of Police’s budget INCREASED by over $10 million dollars. The first goal listed on the budget is to improve “boots on the ground” field operations. This is not a budget dedicated to keeping citizens safe and healthy.

I demand that budgeting funds are moved from the Bureau of Police (~18.8% of Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget) towards programs that support housing, jobs, education, and improve quality of life in our community and for Black Pittsburghers.

Here are some departments from the Operations and Capital budgets that could use this financial support:

Office of Equity - only allocated $1,758,022 (~0.29% of 2020 Operating Budget)
Neighborhood and Community Development - only allocated $7,502,080 (~6.8% of 2020 Capital Budget)
Community Based Organizations - only allocated $500,000 (~0.45% of 2020 Capital Budget)
Neighborhood Employment Centers - only allocated $150,000 (~0.14% of Capital Budget)
Pittsburgh Employment Program - only allocated $150,000 (~0.14% of Capital Budget)
Fair Housing - only allocated $100,000 (~0.09% of Capital Budget)

The lack of community support is evident in the Pittsburgh 2020 budget. No amount of tweets, photo-ops, bare minimum training, or grand promises will make up for the fact that the city is not monetarily invested in supporting its people. Move to make real change in the city of Pittsburgh by divesting from the Bureau of Police and funneling money back into supporting the community.

Hello,

  My name is {fullname}, and I am a resident of Nashville. I am writing to say that I am strongly against BL2020-286.

  The mayor's budget would spend $496 million on a "public safety" system that does not keep us safe. The vast majority of that money would be spent on police, jails, and courts. That means the mayor wants to spend more on cops and cages than on almost all public goods combined. This isn't how we create public safety. True public safety requires fully-funded and community-controlled resources, not more police and jails.

  In the midst of a budget crisis, the mayor is proposing we increase spending on police and jails, and decrease spending on affordable housing, social services, transit, and other critical public goods. This is unacceptable and will not keep us safe.

  Overpoliced communities are not safe communities. Thriving communities are safe communities, and communities thrive when they are well-resourced. We deserve a budget that divests from policing and jails and uses that money to invest in our communities.

Dear City Council Members,

My name is {fullname}  and I am a resident of Austin, Texas. I am outraged at the excessive use of force that APD used against protesters this weekend. Using police brutality against people peacefully protesting police brutality is, at the very least, a bad look and, to be honest, is proof that these protests are necessary. A sixteen year old Chicano boy was shot while standing away from the main crowd of protestors, and a twenty year old Black man was shot in the head and remains in critical condition. A pregnant Black woman was shot in her stomach and back with "non-lethal" rounds by APD. The use of tear gas (prohibited for use in WARFARE by many international treaties) and rubber bullets (not meant to be shot point blank, but has been) against unarmed protesters is absolutely unacceptable.

Following the murder of Mike Ramos and the recent city report that found a culture of misogyny and racism at APD, I am calling on you to seriously reduce city funding to APD and to implement immediate reform. There is no reason that over ⅓ of Austin’s budget should be allocated to the police. In the middle of a pandemic and a recession, we should be using our city's budget to fund affordable housing and public health rather than a violent police department that is, quite frankly, upholding policies and practices that allow white supremacy to take Black lives every single day. Thank you for your work to serve our city.

Sincerely,
The People of Austin, TX

Hello, my name is {fullname} and I live in Austin.

WE ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO DEMAND THAT YOU, MY LOCAL OFFICIALS, WILL:

1. Vote no on all increases to police budgets
2. Vote yes to decrease police spending and budgets
3. Vote yes to increase spending on Health care, education and community programs that keep us safe.

Black communities across the nation are mourning the deaths of George Floyd, tortured to death by Minneapolis police, Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was killed while running in a residential neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, Breonna Taylor an EMT killed while asleep in her bed in Louisville,KY, Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis and Tony McDade in Tallahassee. Their names are added to a devastatingly long list of Black people who have been killed at the hands of vigilantes or law enforcement. Not to mention the others whose names we don’t yet know, and may never know since they were killed without a camera recording it.

At the same time, the United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases. So far, more than 100,000 people — enough to fill a football stadium– have perished from the virus,with over one million cases confirmed, and those numbers don’t reflect all the people dying from virus-related illnesses. Black people are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19, four times more likely to die than their white neighbors.

It is important to state this within the context of the scourge of anti-Black police terror and the resulting uprisings taking place across the U.S.

The COVID-19 deaths and the deaths caused by police terror are connected and consequential to each other. The United States does not have a national healthcare system. Instead, we have the largest military budget in the world, and some of the most well-funded and militarized police departments in the world, too. Policing and militarization overwhelmingly dominate the bulk of national and local budgets. In fact, police and military funding has increased every single year since 1973, and  at the same time, funding for public health decreased every year, crystallized  most recently when the Trump administration eliminated the US Pandemic Response Team in 2018, citing “costs”.

Black communities are living in persistent fear of being killed by state authorities like police, immigration agents or even white vigilantes who are emboldened by state actors. According to the Urban Institute, in 1977, state and local governments spent $60 billion on police and corrections . In 2017, they spent $194 billion. A 220 percent increase. Despite continued profiling, harassment, terror and killing of Black communities, local and federal decision-makers continue to invest in the police, which leaves Black people vulnerable and our communities no safer.

Where could that money go? It could go towards building healthy communities, to the health of our elders and children,to neighborhood infrastructure, to education, to childcare, to support a vibrant Black future. The possibilities are endless.

We join in solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis, Louisville, and across the United States. And we call for the end to police terror.

The Charlottesville Police Department has been a waste of our resources. For FY 2021, $18M has been allocated to CPD.

I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” I am  demanding that my voice be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

Rather than prioritize the quality of life for all of Seattle with a proportional housing and development budget, Mayor Durkan chooses to prioritize the SPD. In the 2019-2020 proposed budget, the funding for the Office of Housing, which provides grants for affordable housing, remained unchanged at only $69.1 million. In comparison, the SPD was allocated a budget of $363 million, representing a 9.7% increase in funds.

This pandemic has had severe economic consequences including high unemployment causing many people to be unable to pay rent. Prior to the pandemic, 60k people were unhoused; the evictions and economic insecurity caused by COVID-19 will bring that number even higher. Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. But instead, out of all departments, the Mayor has proposed an increase in funding to the SPD. The SPD has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing people who are unhoused, Black, Indigenous, and people of color. This money can be spent in other ways that are proven to be more effective in improving community safety and wellness.

My name is {fullname}, and I’m a resident of Charleston, West Virginia. I am writing about the Charleston fiscal year 2021 budget and call for you to review city policies surrounding police.

I am asking that the City of Charleston makes a more overt and visible commitment to racial justice. I demand that the budget be amended and reviewed so that Council may find ways to redirect money away from Charleston Police Department’s overinflated budget. I urge you to pressure the City Manager’s Office and our local officials towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s expenditures, away from PD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality.

Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons (Source: Popular Democracy). As such, I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas. West Virginia and our city's budgets are already struggling. We need to devote more money to building community and community resources across the state.

Do not forget our poor communities and communities of color in West Virginia who are disproportionate targets of police violence. Justice will only be served when the police are reformed, and this will not be possible until we defund them.

Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget and review policing methods that puts a focus on social service programs?

Thank you,
